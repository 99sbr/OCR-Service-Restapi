## Code Structure

- `api_template:`  Contains all the API related Code Base.
    - `manage.py:` Only entry point for API. Contains no logic. 
    - `.env:` Most important file for your api and contains global configs. Acoid using application/variable level configs here.
    - `application:`  It contains all your api related codes and test modules. I prefer keeping application folder at global.
    - `logs`: Logs is self-explanatory. FYI it will not contain any configuration information, just raw logs. Feel free to move according to your comfort but not inside the application folder.
    - `settings:` Logger/DataBase/Model global settings files in yaml/json format.

- `application:` 
    - `main:` priority folder of all your application related code.
        - `ðŸ“® routers:` API routers and they strictly do not contain any business logic
        - `ðŸ“¡ services:` All processing and business logic for routers here at service layer
        - `âš’ utility:`
            - `logger` Logging module for application
            - `manager` A manager utility for Data Related Task which can be common for different services
    - `test:` Write test cases for your application here.
    - `initializer.py:` Preload/Initialisation of Models and Module common across application. Preloading model improves inferencing.
